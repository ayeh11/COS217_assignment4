Student 1: What authorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? COPY THE LIST of authorized sources of
information given in the "Policies" web page (also available on armlab
in the file ~cos217/AuthorizedSourcesList ) to this section of the
readme file, and edit it as appropriate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Student 1: What unauthorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information
that you used to complete the assignment, and describe how you used
them. The course "Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of
information, and any source that you have used but not listed in the
authorized sources should be included here. Please note that using an
unauthorized source may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the
nature of the interaction, may additionally require the interaction
being reported to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used
no unauthorized sources of information.

(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate for Part 2's checker, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

checkerDT.h:17:9: Function exported but not used outside checkerDT:
                        CheckerDT_Node_isValid
      checkerDT.c:43:1: Definition of CheckerDT_Node_isValid

The issue with checkerDT.c is linked to checkerDT.h and other files that
do not use this module. Since the use of this checker module is out of
the scope of our assignment, we can disregard this warning. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on checkerDT.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."



------------------------------------------------------------------------
For each of the five faulty BDT implementations required by Step
1.5, identify the function where there is a bug. You do not have to
identify the bug itself, only its location, but note that this must be
the location of the underlying error, which is not necessarily where
the error manifests itself or is "noticed" by the client.


      Executable         Function with the underlying error
===============================================================
         ./bdtBad1        BDT_insert() - does not check for 
                                          bIsInitialized
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad2        BDT_freeSubtree() - second child does not move
                                          after removal of first child 
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad3        BDT_addChild() - child is set as current child
                                          of parents instead of param
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad4        BDT_strlenAccumulate() - did not add one
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad5        BDT_findNode() - did not free oPPath
===============================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are your critiques of the given DT implementations, as
specified in Step 2.5?


Unclear Naming:
- Variables like ulCount might cause confusion as to what exactly is
being counted. Instead, use a name like ulNodeCount.
- Function names like Node_getNumChildren don't match with the naming
scheme of using "count" to refer to the number of a specific quantity 
- Instead, using a name like Node_getChildCount would be more in line
with the naming scheme established in other parts of the codebase.

Inconsistent parameter order:
- Node_new parameter order is (Path_T oPPath, Node_T oNParent, Node_T
poNResult), but boolean Node_hasChild parameter order is (Node_T 
oNParent, Path_T oPPath, size_tpulChildID)
- It would make more sense if they were consistent. Since we add new
child nodes in the parameter order (Path_T [path of child], Node_T [the 
parent node]), it makes sense to check if a parent has the child in the 
same order of (Path_T [path of child], Node_T [the parent node]) 
instead of (Node_T, Path_T)

Potential for weaker coupling:
- dtGood finds the depth of a node by calling "Path_getDepth
(Node_getPath(oNCurr));"
- Instead, could make a function and implementation in nodeDT that
returns the depth of a node when input a node.
- For example, making a function in nodeDT called 
      Node_getDepth(Node_T oNCurr);
- This would weaken coupling between dtGood and path
